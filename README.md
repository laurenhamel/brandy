# What Is Brandy

Brandy is a compiled [Sass](//sass-lang.com) library of helper mixins and functions all in one place. It's written in pure Sass and designed for efficiency, so you can write stylesheets faster.

# Why Brandy

Brandy was built as way of compiling some of the best-of-the-best Sass snippets that exist today. That's why you'll find that Brandy not only incorporates mixins and functions that will help you write better Sass, but it also includes many helpers that will allow you to start writing your own utility mixins and functions in no time.

# Getting Started

To start using Brandy, simply [download the latest release](/releases/latest) and include the contents of the `scss/` folder in your project.

## Disclaimer
This library has been compiled by [Lauren Hamel](www.laurenhamel.me). While some mixins and functions are the author's original work, many mixins and functions have been pulled from other sources, meaning they likely have other authors and/or may use different licenses. The author of this library has attempted to give credit where credit was due, but please note that some inconsistencies may still exist.
